# Shopping Cart App

A new shopping cart application developed on flutter. App contains three different screens.

1) [Home Screen](/example/screenshots/1_home.png) - To show the drug list.
2) [Drug Description Screen](/example/screenshots/2_drug_info.png) - To show the details of drug.
3) [Cart Screen](/example/screenshots/3_cart.png) - To list the items in my cart.

Please find an APK file in *example/apk* directory to install and verify. I've attached my screenshots and screen recordings in *example/screenshots* directory.


### Example
- [App flow: Screen recording](/example/screenshots/screen_recording.mp4)

### Note

I've spent around 2-3  hours to complete this. Just attempted to develop best possible UI (Given screenshot) and operations.

Please find an screen recordings in *example/screenshots* directory.

In this app I've used two libraries from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/)

- [Toast: To Show Toast message](https://pub.dev/packages/fluttertoast)
- [BLoC: For state management](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)
